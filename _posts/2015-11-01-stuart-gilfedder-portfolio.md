# Corporate Events

I am a creative media professional with over 10 years of experience in the industry. Since the age of 16 I have worked in the following areas relating to events, media and audio visual.

My corporate event experienced flourished working with a North American Audio Visual company called PSAV. Through my time working with PSAV, I have furthered my skills in sales, creative, event management and audio visual.

My experience working in the Corporate event industry has allowed me to coin new skills in relation to technical, international and financial.
